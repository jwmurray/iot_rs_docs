# A Webserver in Rust

Rust is a statically compiled, fast language with great tooling and a rapidly growing ecosystem.
That makes it a great fit for writing backend servers and for writing embedded firmware to control IoT sensors.
IoT sensors are a great opportunity to learn Rust!

Writing a simple Web Server microservice that receives incoming sensor data 
is a great exercise for a beginner who is new to the language and wants to get a feel for it.

In parallel, we write a complete rust firmware application that runs on "bare metal" to retrieve sensor data and relay that to the Web Server.

## Book Structure
This book offers tutorials in two parallel tracks:
* a tutorial on writing a web server in rust
* a tutorial on writing an embedded application in rust

Build a web server on one box and then blink a light on a micro-controller.  Follow these up with successive layers
 that teach how to bring these two parallel tracks to create a cohesive microservice.
 Feel free to jump back and forth between the two tracks.

You'll be exposed to a few of the core concepts of Rust as well as the main aspects of web servers and IoT sensors.

## Send Us Feedback!
One last thing before we dive right into Server and Sensor applications:
If you find an error in this book
or want to help us write more content for it,
you can find the source of this work [in the Rust IoT book repository][book-src].
We'd love to hear your feedback!
Thank you!
